# Rescaling-and-Reducing-Noise-in-a-Data-Stream
Problem: An Arduino board has some sort of sensor that is accepting inputs. These inputs can be quite erratic so 
we'll want to reduce the noise of it along with smoothing out erratic data.

The input #'s generated are from 230-620 and we want the data to be scaled down to 0-255.

0-255 because we want to calibrate a light sensor with this data.

This is probably to assess the difference between black and white or possibly the absence or presence of light as an object approaches the sensor. 
In addition the sensor appears to be quite sensitive as number are changing drastically and need to be smoothed out.
